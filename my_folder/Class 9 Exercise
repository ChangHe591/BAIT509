1.	Construct the decision rule according to this classification boundary. How would you classify a new observation that has x1=6x1=6 and x2=10x2=10?
To the left of the line x1=7.5, the points will be classified as A
To the right of the line x1=7.5, the points will be classified as B
A new observation will be classified as A.

2.	What size is the margin here?
2

3.	Which observations receive a penalty? Which observations are the support vectors?
Observation 7, 6, 8, 9
Support vectors: 7, 6, 8, 9

4.	What is the total penalty here?
0.25+0.25+1.75+1.25+2.25=5.75

5.	Can I choose a bigger margin if my total allowable penalty is 6?
No.

6.	Are the data separable? If so, what are the support vectors?
Yes. 8 and 9
