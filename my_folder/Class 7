"	Bagging is a special case of random forests under which case?

When the subset is the same as all predictors

"	What are the hyperparameters we can control for random forests?

Tree size and the number of predictors to sample

Suppose you have the following paired data of (x,y): (1,2), (1,5), (2,0). Which of the following are valid bootstrapped data sets? Why/why not?
1.	(1,0), (1,2), (1,5)
2.	(1,2), (2,0)
3.	(1,2), (1,2), (1,5)

1 is not because (1,0) is not an observation out the data set
2 is not valid because there are only two pairs.
3 Yes

"	For each of the above valid bootstapped data sets, which observations are out-of-bag (OOB)?

For 3, (2,0) is out of bag error

You make a random forest consisting of four trees. You obtain a new observation of predictors, and would like to predict the response. What would your prediction be in the following cases?
1.	Regression: your trees make the following four predictions: 1,1,3,3.
2.	Classification: your trees make the following four predictions: "A", "A", "B", "C".

1.	The prediction is 2
2.	The prediction is A
